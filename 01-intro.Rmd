# Introduction {#intro}

The following R codes are from UCLA website "https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/seminars/rsem/" and I do not own the copyright of the R code. I wrote this R Markdown file for my own study purpose.

## Definitions (Basic Concepts)

### Observed variable

Observed variable: A variable that exists in the data (a.k.a item or manifest variable)

### Latent variable

Latent variable: A variable that is constructed and does not exist in the data.

### Exogenous variable

Exogenous variable: An independent variable either observed (X) or latent ($\xi$) that explains an engogenous variable.

## Read the data into the R Studio environment.

It also calcuates the covariance matrix among all the variables in the data.

```{R}

dat <- read.csv("https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/worland5.csv")
cov(dat)

```

In the following, we conduct a simple linear regression.
$$sample \ variance-covariance \ matrix \hat{\sum} = \mathbf{S} $$

```{R}

m1a <- lm(read ~ motiv, data=dat)
(fit1a <-summary(m1a))

```

```{R}
library(lavaan)
#simple regression using lavaan 
m1b <-   '
  # regressions
    read ~ 1 + motiv
  # variance (optional)
    motiv ~~ motiv
'

fit1b <- sem(m1b, data=dat)
summary(fit1b)
```
