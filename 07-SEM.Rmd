# Bootstrapping 

The following note is made when I was studying Bret Larget's note posted online.
http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~larget/stat302/chap3.pdf

He used the data from LOck5data as an example.

```{r}
library(Lock5Data)
data(CommuteAtlanta)
str(CommuteAtlanta)

time.mean = with(CommuteAtlanta, mean(Time))

time.mean
```

Now, he sampled a b*n table. Note that, the Atlanta data has 500 row, as it has 500 observations (or, people). But, in the following new matrix, it is 1000*500 table. Also, it should be noted that the logic of sample function in R. This webpage provides some insight into this function. Basically, the following R code randomly sample a bigger sample of 1000*500 from those 500 data points. After that, the matrix function put such 1000*500 data points into a matrix.  


```{r}
B = 1000
n = nrow(CommuteAtlanta)
boot.samples = matrix(sample(CommuteAtlanta$Time, size = B * n, replace = TRUE),
                      B, n)
```
